              without the big agency complexity or cost.

        </div>
        <h3>A Small Business Owner Serving Small Business Owners</h3>
        <p>
          As a bootstrapped business owner myself, I intimately understand the challenges you face:
          limited time, tight budgets, and the need to focus on what you do best while outsourcing
          the rest effectively.
        </p>
        <p>My approach is built on three core principles:</p>
        <ul class="philosophy-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Simplicity</strong> - No complex jargon or overwhelming options. Just clear
            solutions that work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Practicality</strong> - Every feature and recommendation focuses on bringing
            real value to your business.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Partnership</strong> - I'm invested in your long-term success, not just
            launching a website and moving on.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Unlike large agencies with multiple team members and complex processes, I provide direct,
          personal service and ongoing support tailored specifically to small, local businesses.

            <h3>How long does it take to build a website?</h3>
            <p>
              Most small business websites take 2-4 weeks from our initial planning session to
              launch. The timeline depends on the complexity of your site and how quickly we can
              gather content.

            <h3>What makes you different from larger agencies?</h3>
            <p>
              As a one-person business, I provide direct, personal service without the overhead of
              larger agencies. You work directly with me throughout the entire process, ensuring
              clear communication and a website tailored specifically to your needs.

            <p>
              I offer transparent, budget-friendly pricing designed specifically for small
              businesses. After our initial consultation, I'll provide a clear proposal with all
              costs outlined—no surprises or hidden fees.

            <h3>Will I be able to update my website myself?</h3>
            <p>
              Absolutely! I build websites on user-friendly platforms and provide training so you
              can make basic updates yourself. For more complex changes, I'm always available to
              help through my ongoing support services.

              Ongoing support is a core part of my business. I offer various support packages to
              ensure your website remains secure, up-to-date, and aligned with your evolving

              businesses in other areas. The personal approach and attention to your specific needs

                Sarah's Bakery had a loyal local customer base but was struggling to attract new
                customers. Their previous website was outdated, difficult to update, and didn't
                showcase their delicious products effectively. As a busy small business owner, Sarah
                needed a solution that would attract customers without requiring constant technical
                management.

        <div class="faq-list">
          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Are there any hidden fees?</h3>
            <p>
              No. As a small business owner myself, I understand the importance of transparent
              pricing. The prices listed include everything mentioned in the package with no
              surprise costs.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I need the ongoing support package?</h3>
            <p>
              While not required, the ongoing support package is recommended to keep your website
              secure, up-to-date, and performing well. Think of it like regular maintenance for your
              car—preventative care saves money in the long run.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I upgrade my package later?</h3>
            <p>
              Absolutely! As your business grows, your website needs may change. We can easily
              upgrade your package or add specific services as needed.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Is there a payment plan available?</h3>
            <p>
              Yes, I understand cash flow concerns for small businesses. We can discuss payment
              plans during our consultation to find an option that works for your budget.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What if I need something not listed in these packages?</h3>
            <p>
              These packages cover the most common needs, but I'm happy to provide custom quotes for
              additional services like e-commerce functionality, booking systems, or other specific
              requirements.
