# Gap Analysis Summary

- Market Gaps:
  - Ongoing education and support for small businesses after website launch
  - Affordable solutions for bootstrapped businesses
  - Simplified service offerings that don't overwhelm small business owners
  - Personal attention from a dedicated consultant (not a large agency)

- Business Constraints:
  - Bootstrapped business with limited resources
  - One-person operation
  - Services must be simple, not requiring specialized licenses/certifications
  - Limited time and money for marketing and operations

- Opportunity Statement:
  - For local small businesses, we deliver ongoing web support and education, unlike competitors who focus only on initial builds. As a bootstrapped, one-person business ourselves, we understand the constraints of small business owners and provide focused, affordable solutions without overwhelming them with complex options.
