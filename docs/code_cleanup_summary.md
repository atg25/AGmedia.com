# AGmedia Website Code Cleanup

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the codebase cleanup performed on the AGmedia website project to improve maintainability, reduce redundancy, and optimize performance.

## CSS Optimization

1. **Consolidated CSS Files**

   - Combined 4 separate CSS files into a single `main.css` file:
     - `styles.css` (global styles)
     - `additional-styles.css` (component styles)
     - `pages-styles.css` (page-specific styles)
     - `mobile-nav.css` (mobile navigation)

2. **Organized CSS Structure**

   - Added clear section comments to improve navigation
   - Grouped related styles together logically
   - Eliminated duplicate rules
   - Standardized variable usage

3. **Improved CSS Organization**
   - Logically grouped related styles (typography, buttons, navigation, etc.)
   - Clear section headers with comments
   - Consistent naming conventions

## JavaScript Optimization

1. **Code Refactoring**

   - Replaced `app.js` with optimized `main.js`
   - Moved functionality into separate, well-named functions
   - Added comprehensive comments
   - Improved code structure for better maintainability

2. **Functional Organization**

   - Separated functionality into distinct, purpose-focused functions
   - Clear function naming for better code readability
   - Added JSDoc comments for function documentation

3. **Initialization Pattern**
   - Implemented a clean initialization pattern using a main DOMContentLoaded event
   - Each major feature has its own initialization function
   - Better separation of concerns

## HTML Optimization

1. **Simplified Link References**
   - Updated all HTML files to reference the consolidated CSS and JS files
   - Maintained font references for consistent typography

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Improved Performance**

   - Reduced HTTP requests by consolidating CSS files
   - Better organized code for faster parsing

2. **Enhanced Maintainability**

   - Clearer code structure
   - Better commented functions
   - Logical organization
   - Reduced duplication

3. **Better Developer Experience**
   - Easier to find and modify specific parts of the codebase
   - More consistent naming and structure
   - Better documented functionality

## Files Changed

- Created new files:

  - `/src/main.css` (consolidated CSS)
  - `/src/main.js` (optimized JavaScript)

- Updated HTML files:
  - `/src/index.html`
  - `/src/services.html`
  - `/src/approach.html`
  - `/src/client-stories.html`
  - `/src/pricing.html`

## Next Steps for Further Optimization

1. **Image Optimization**

   - Consider implementing image lazy loading for better performance
   - Standardize image sizes and formats

2. **Advanced CSS Techniques**

   - Consider implementing CSS custom properties for more theming flexibility
   - Explore CSS Grid for more advanced layouts

3. **JavaScript Enhancements**
   - Add form validation with better error messages
   - Consider implementing a more robust slider with touch support
